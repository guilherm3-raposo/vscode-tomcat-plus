Initial release



### Disclaimer

This is very much a work in progress, and I made this because [adashen's](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adashen.vscode-tomcat) doesn't quite do everything I want. I'll be adding functionality and fixing bugs whenever I can, and I'll do my best to keep it updated.

**Happy coding! ðŸ¤“â˜•**
